Building Cpuset from Source
===========================
This is a distutils-based package and as such, it contains
a number of differnet installation methods.  By far the most
convenient is to create an rpm.  This rpm can then be later
updated or removed by the rpm packaging utility (rpm).

To create an rpm, use the following command:

	python setup.py bdist_rpm

For basic installation:

	python setup.py install

By default, the above command installs cpuset in the
/usr/local/{bin,lib,share} directories. For a different location,
use the --prefix option:

	python setup.py install --prefix=/usr

Prebuild Binary Packages
========================
Alternatively, you may download pre-built binary packages for multiple
distributions from the Open Build Service here:
